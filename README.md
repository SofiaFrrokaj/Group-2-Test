# Student Outcome Analysis

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about students, including demographics, academic performance, and outcomes. The target variable (`Target`) has three classes:
- `Graduate`
- `Dropout`
- `Enrolled`

## Key Findings
1. **Target Distribution**:
   - `Graduate`: 2209
   - `Dropout`: 1421
   - `Enrolled`: 794

2. **Model Performance**:
   - Logistic Regression Model:
     - Training Accuracy: 71.31%
     - Testing Accuracy: 69.80%
   - The model shows moderate performance but can be improved.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - Class imbalance in the dataset.
   - Data leakage due to improper scaling of test data.
   - Logistic regression model did not converge.
